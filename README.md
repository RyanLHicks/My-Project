## Conclusion

#### Final Thoughts:
- Using PowerBI, I was able to understand how this tool can be used in various applications that allows for easy snapshot of complex data. Being creative is a must when using this tool to properly organize and tell a story about a certain data set. There are many more applications to be used and to showcase in various fields such as healthcare, energy, retail, and many more but I beleive that using this tool as a foundation for storytelling is imperative for proper understanding of complex data.
